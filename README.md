New memory type H5GC8H24AJ
New Micron, Hynix, Samsung and Elpida timings, better hashrate and stability
License checking fixes Some fixes and bugs (Including Hynix typo)
New design
RX 560 detection due to different timings need

Tooltips
All in 1
Timings optimized for ETH and XMR or Universal, you can choose which one you want (available only for some memory types)
Timings for 4GB or 8GB cards auto choosing the best timings for your card memory size (available only for some memory types)
Detect more types of memory and applies suitable timings (compared to PBE 1.6.7 and 1.7.0), new added support for H5GQ4H24AJ
Automatic undervolting, overclocking, underclocking (power saving option)
Gives the biggest hashrate boost compared to stock, for the 100% performance still need to manually tweak memory clocks and core voltages, editor cannot predict card quality so it‚Äôs impossible to automatically use the top values
Windows and Linux option, note Linux option only does no undervolting
Supports almost all RX cards Polaris and Baffin (RX 460/470/480/560/570/580), (RX550 only few of them, contact me before buy)
In next releases more intuitive timings patcher and undervolting
Pro Performance Timings
No memory timings shifting. Pro Performance memory timings

One Click Timing Patcher
It recognizes cards, memory types and memory size

Power Saving Option
New Power saving option! Automatically undervolt memory and core also underclock core

Auto OC

If you don't trust the EXE just build on Linux with ```sh build.sh```. Quick and easy.

### Important: You need to disable SecureBoot / Activate CSM in your
